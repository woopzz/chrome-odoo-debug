This is a chrome extension to switch between Odoo debug modes.

Odoo manages debug mode by `debug` param in the url. There are 3 ways:

1. Debug mode without assets.
2. Debug mode with assets.
3. Disabled debug.

In order to change them easly this extension shows a popup with options and it provides keybindings ...

1. Ctrl+Shift+1
2. Ctrl+Shift+2
3. Ctrl+Shift+3

_(respectively)_
